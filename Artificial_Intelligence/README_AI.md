# AI Practicals Repository

This repository contains all **AI practical experiments** for your college course, divided into **Basic** and **Advanced** implementations.  

- **Basic experiments** focus on simple outputs and core AI concepts.  
- **Advanced experiments** include **visualizations, animations, and interactive outputs** for deeper understanding.
